# Tim

The young reporter Tintin is the hero of the series "Tintin". Tintin doesn't seem to have a family. He works as a reporter for the Belgian newspaper Petit XXiÃ¨me, but you hardly see him doing his job. Apart from that he is fully occupied with fighting against evil, even though he is introduced everywhere as "the famous reporter" and he sometimes uses alleged reports or surveys as a camouflage for research.
